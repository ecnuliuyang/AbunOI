Description: This package implements the semiparametric empirical likelihood (EL) inference for abundance via EM algorithms. We fit the one-inflated capture-recapture data by zero-truncated one-inflated regression model and one-inflated zero-truncated regression model. Under these models, this package provides the maximum EL estimator and EL ratio confidence interval of the population size or abundance. The maximum EL estimator and bootstrap-based standard error are provided for the regression coefficients. The EL-based score tests are also provided for testing the existence of one-inflation.
