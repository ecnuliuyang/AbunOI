\usage{
loglikelihood_ztoi(N, y, x, beta, z, eta, alpha, prob, dist, K)
}
\arguments{
\item{N}{number specifying the value of abundance.}

\item{y}{number of times that individuals were captured}

\item{x}{matrix containing the individual covariates which have influence on the capture probability.}

\item{beta}{vector of regression cofficients in the capture probability model}

\item{z}{matrix containing the individual covariates which have influence on the probability of one-inflation.}

\item{eta}{vector of regression cofficients in the one-inflated probability model}

\item{alpha}{number, the probability of never being captured}

\item{prob}{vector, the probability mass function of covariates}

\item{dist}{character specification of count regression model family, \code{"poisson"} or \code{"binomial"}.}

\item{K}{number specifying the number of capture occasions when \code{dist} is \code{"binomial"}.}
